# AGH-ASD-2023-2024

This GitHub repository contains my solutions to tasks from classes, tests, and exams for the Algorithms and Data Structures course from the academic year 2023-2024. Below, you will find a description of the Algorithms and Data Structures course at AGH University of Science and Technology (2023-2024 edition).

This course is divided into three parts:

1. **Sorting Problems**
2. **Graph Problems**
3. **Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms**

### Course Workflow

- During each part, students are required to solve 3 tasks independently and submit them via UPeL.
- After each part, there is a colloquium.
- There is a supplementary colloquium for students who missed one of the three previous colloquia and had a valid excuse for their absence.
- Finally, there is a final exam consisting of 2 tasks.
- To sit for the exam, students need to collect a total of 10 points. Points can be earned from offline tasks, during classes, or from colloquia.
