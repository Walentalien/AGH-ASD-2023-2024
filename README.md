# AGH-ASD-2023-2024
This GitHub repository contains my solutions to tasks from classes, tests, and exams for the Algorithm and Data Structures course from the academic year 2023-2024.
This course was divided into three parts: the first part focuses on sorting problems, the second on graph problems, and the third on dynamic programming (and greedy algorithms, which are a special case of dynamic programming).
