# AGH-ASD-2023-2024
This GitHub repository contains my solutions to tasks from classes, tests, and exams for the Algorithm and Data Structures course from the academic year 2023-2024. 
Down here you will find description of Algorithms and Data structures course on AGH University of Cracow (2023-2024 edition).

This course was divided into three parts: the first part focuses on sorting problems, the second on graph problems, and the third on dynamic programming (and greedy algorithms, which are a special case of dynamic programming).
During each part students were supposed to solve 3 tasks on their own and submit them via UPeL.After aech part we had collogium . These three parts were followed by suplementary colloqium for students who missed one of three previous colloquims ( and had an exucuse for being absent ). After this we had final exam consisting from 2 tasks. To sit the exam you needed to collect 10 points in total, you could have gotten these for offline tasks, during classes of for collogiuums.

This will help you navigate this repository:

Happy learning!
